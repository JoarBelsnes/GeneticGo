# GeneticGo - genetic algorithm library written in Go

This is a library I'm building while learning to code in Go

## Samples (in order written)

- string_duplication.go - duplicates a string, see [related blog post](http://handcraftsman.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/first-program-in-go-simple-genetic-solver/)

    go run samples/string_duplication.go

- 8queens.go - solves the 8 Queens Puzzle, see [related blog post](http://handcraftsman.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/solving-the-8-queens-puzzle-with-go/)

    go run samples/8queens.go

## Usage

import genetic/genetic.go in your program
